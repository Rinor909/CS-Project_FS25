# Zurich Real Estate Price Prediction - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project creates a Streamlit web application that predicts real estate prices in Zurich based on:
- Location (neighborhood)
- Property characteristics (room count, building age)
- Travel time to key destinations

The application provides an interactive interface for exploring property prices across Zurich, visualizing geographical price patterns, and understanding how various factors influence property values.

## Key Features

1. **Price Prediction**: Machine learning model to predict property prices based on selected parameters
2. **Interactive Maps**: Visualize price distributions across Zurich neighborhoods
3. **Travel Time Analysis**: Explore how commute times to key destinations affect property prices
4. **Historical Trends**: View property price trends over time (2009-2024)
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare prices across different neighborhoods and property types

## Project Components

### Data Sources
- **Neighborhood Data** (`bau515od5155.csv`): Property prices by neighborhood, 2009-2024
- **Building Age Data** (`bau515od5156.csv`): Property prices by building age, 2009-2024
- **Travel Time Data**: Generated travel times from neighborhoods to key destinations

### Machine Learning Model
- Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Features: neighborhood, room count, building age, travel time
- Performance metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²

### Streamlit Application
- User interface for parameter selection
- Interactive visualizations
- Real-time price predictions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Load raw CSV files
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, rename columns)
3. Generate travel time features
4. Save processed data for model training

### Model Development
1. Feature engineering (one-hot encoding for categorical variables)
2. Train multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
3. Hyperparameter tuning via grid search
4. Model evaluation and selection based on performance metrics
5. Save best model for use in application

### Application Structure
1. Main app (`app.py`): Core Streamlit application
2. Utilities (`utils.py`): Data loading and processing functions
3. Maps (`maps.py`): Interactive map visualizations

## Future Enhancements

1. **GeoJSON Integration**: Add actual Zurich neighborhood boundaries for more accurate maps
2. **Real-time API**: Connect to real estate APIs for current pricing data
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more property filters (e.g., amenities, property type)
4. **Price Trends Prediction**: Forecast future price trends using time series analysis
5. **Mortgage Calculator**: Add financial planning tools based on predicted prices

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning and interactive visualizations can be combined to create a practical tool for real estate price prediction and analysis. The Streamlit application provides an intuitive interface for exploring Zurich's property market, helping users make informed decisions based on location, property characteristics, and travel preferences.
